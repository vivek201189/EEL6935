This is the final submission of the code, screenshots, and graphs for the Final Project for UF EEL6935 Big Data Ecosystems course by team T1-NewGAN. 

All hyperparameters experimented and used have been noted in the excel sheet named 'HyperparameterSheet.xlsx'.

Steps to Run:

Step 1: All the codes assume that the datasets are already downloaded.

Step 2: Once Step 1 is complete, simply run the files. No changes needed.

Step 3: Written in Keras v2.0 with TensorFlow 1.0. 
  - Any library core updates might break the code.
  - Older versions will give different/wrong output.

NOTE: The GAN models take a very long time converge (> 10000 epochs, avg epoch time = ~ 6sec). Therefore, it is better to run on GPUs. Also, for about 600-700 eopchs, the outputs generated don't make much sense.
